The program should accept several command line arguments:

--system
        to indicate that only the system usage should be generated


--user

        to indicate that only the users usage should be generated


--graphics

        to include graphical output in the cases where a graphical outcome is possible as indicated below.


--samples=N

        if used the value N will indicate how many times the statistics are going to be collected and results will be average and reported based on the N number of repetitions.
If not value is indicated the default value will be 10.


--tdelay=T

        to indicate how frequently to sample in seconds.
If not value is indicated the default value will be 1 sec.

 

The last two arguments can also be considered as positional arguments if not flag is indicated in the corresponding order: samples tdelay.


The reported "stats" should include:

 user usage
 report how many users are connected in a given time
 report how many sessions each user is connected to
 system usage
report how much utilization of the CPU is being done
report how much utilization of memory is being done (report used and free memory)
if the --graphics flag is used, generate a graphical representation showing the variation of memory used
